# 📄 PDF RAG Chatbot

To try it - open [**Link**](https://pdf-rag-chatbot-8mmj.onrender.com)

A conversational AI chatbot that allows users to upload PDFs and query their contents. The app uses **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** with:

- 📚 **ChromaDB** for vector storage
- 🔎 **Google Generative AI Embeddings** for text embeddings
- 🧠 **Groq LLaMA3 (via LangChain)**
- 🌐 **Streamlit** frontend for an interactive chat UI

Each conversation is **isolated**, with its own vector DB and file uploads (like ChatGPT).

## 🚀 Features

- Upload one or more PDFs per conversation
- Ask natural language questions about the uploaded documents
- Conversational memory (chat history)
- Show document sources for each answer
- Answer 'I don't know' when the PDF doesn't have any information'
- Multiple conversation threads (each with its own PDF set & DB)
- Reset, clear, or create new conversations at any time
- **🔒 Ephemeral Storage System**: Each user gets an isolated session with automatic cleanup
- **💰 Cost-Efficient**: No persistent user data storage - reduces cloud and database costs
- **🔐 Privacy-First**: User data is completely isolated and automatically deleted

## 📖 Workflow

1. **Upload a PDF** → The file is processed, split into chunks, and embedded into ChromaDB.
2. **Ask a Question** → The retriever fetches relevant chunks, and the LLM answers using context.
3. **View Sources** → Expand to see which PDF pages were used for the answer.
4. **Conversations** → Start new chats with different PDFs (each isolated).
